    // 	dentry. The "i_count" field in the inode structure should be

    // 	instead of replacing the target.  The VFS already checks for
    // 	existence, so for local filesystems the RENAME_NOREPLACE
    // 	implementation is equivalent to plain rename.
    // 	(2) RENAME_EXCHANGE: exchange source and target.  Both must
    // 	exist; this is checked by the VFS.  Unlike plain rename,
    // 	source and target may be of different type.
